    <p>List of cat coats with little chibi drawings.
        Most siamese are colorpoints: markings based on body heat.</p>

                    <li>Seal Point<br>
                        <text>Most recognizable color pattern, with warm tan body and deep brown extremeties.</text><br>

                    <li>Chocolate Point<br>
                        <text>Very similar to seal point, differences being a lighter cream body and richer, chocolate brown extremeties.</text><br>

                    <li>Blue Point<br>
                        <text>"Blue" is a common term for the cool grey tones of the extremeties, with an exceptionally pale body.</text><br>
                        <img src="Blue.png" alt="Drawing demonstrating blue point coat color and markings." width="200px">
                    </li>
                    <li>Lilac Point<br>
                        <text>Similar to blue point, with a pale body and even lighter grey dusted over the extremeties.</text><br>

                <ul>                    
                    <li>Flame Point<br>
                    <text>Also known as "Orange Point." The body is a warm cream, and the extremeties are orange with stripes. This color was created by introducing a tabby cat into the breeding pool. Although this gene introduction may have been many generations back, this mix is why this color is not considered "pure" by some breed standards. Flame Points are also almost always male! The gene that produces orange coloring is on the X chromosome. Females need two copies of the gene to appear orange, while males only need one!</text><br>

                </li>
                <li>Lynx Point<br>
                    <text>Also known as "Tabby Point." The body is warm tan, and can sometimes be covered in liver-colored stripes. The extremeties are a dusty grey with dark brown to black stripes. Similar to the flame point, these markings are thanks to tabby genes being introduced to the breeding pool.</text><br>
                    <img src="Lynx.png" alt="Drawing demonstrating lynx point coat color and markings." width="200px"><br>
                    <text><small>Note: I have a Lynx Point! Her name is Mona!</small></text>
                </li>
                <li>Tortie Point<br>
                    <text>Also known as "<strong>Extremely</strong> Rare." The body is anywhere from tan to cream, and the extremeties are mottled orange and brown or blue. This coat can only be achieved when an orange cat breeds with a purebred siamese cat that has one of the Standard Breed color coats. Not only that, but the resulting kitten <em>must</em> be female. As mentioned earlier, female cats need two copies of the orange gene to fully exhibit an orange coat. Tortie points are the result of one X chromosome carrying the orange gene, and the other X not. Technically, male tortie points do exist, but are <em>even more rare</em>. This is because they have two X chromosomes and one Y! </text><br>
