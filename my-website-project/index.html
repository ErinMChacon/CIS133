            <p>Originally a pet of Thailand royalty, the Siamese is now very popular today - regardless of social
                status. They are coveted for their affectionate nature, intelligence, and incessant need to chat.
                Not many cat breeds are as recognizable as a Siamese, and this is due to their very specific body
                type and coat pattern!</p>

                <p>This cat is long and lithe, with a very graceful appearance. All Siamese have bright blue eyes that
                    are large and almond shaped. The ears are fairly large and placed on a wedge or apple shaped head,
                    and the tail is very long and thin. Arguably, the most identifiable aspect of the Siamese is their
                    two-toned coat.</p>

                <h2 id="Coat_Types" class="header">Coat Types</h2>
                <p>The distinctive coat pattern is usually refered to as <strong>colorpoint</strong>. This pattern is
                    the result of a mutation in melanin production, making the relating enzyme heat sensitive. In other
                    words, the warmest parts of the cat's body are a light color, while the cooler extremeties such as
                    ears, face, legs, and tail are darker.</p>
                <p>While all Siamese have colorpoint coats, the actual colors do vary. There are seven official coat
                    colors.</p>

                    <p>Out of the seven coat colors, only four are recognized as "Breed Standard." Cats with these coats
                        can be showed and officially papered due to the purity of their bloodlines. </p>

                        <figcaption>
                            "Blue" is a common term for the cool grey tones of the extremeties, with an
                            exceptionally pale body.

                        <figcaption>
                            Similar to blue point, with a pale body and even lighter grey dusted over the
                            extremeties.

                    <h3 id="Other_Colors" class="header">Other Colors</h3>
                    <p>The remaining coat colors are more recent in the breed's history. In order to achieve these
                        colors, a different cat breed must be introduced into the gene pool. This fact excludes them
                        from being officially recognized. However, outside of show situations and frankly bizarre
                        elitism about cat eugenics, they are considered Siamese cats regardless. </p>

                    <h4 class="header">Flame Point</h4>
                    <figure>

                            width="200">
                        <figcaption>Also known as "Orange Point." The body is a warm cream, and the extremeties are
                            orange with stripes. This color was created by introducing a tabby cat into the
                            breeding pool. Flame Points are also almost always male! The gene that produces
                            orange coloring is on the X chromosome. Females need two copies of the gene to
                            appear orange, while males only need one!

                    <h4 class="header">Lynx Point</h4>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Lynx.png" alt="Drawing demonstrating lynx point coat color and markings."
                            width="200">
                        <figcaption>
                            Also known as "Tabby Point." The body is warm tan, and can sometimes be covered in
                            liver-colored stripes. The extremeties are a dusty grey with dark brown to black
                            stripes. Similar to the flame point, these markings are thanks to tabby genes being
                            introduced to the breeding pool.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h4 class="header">Tortie Point</h4>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Tortie.png" alt="Drawing demonstrating Tortie point coat color and markings."
                            width="200">
                        <figcaption>
                            Also known as "<strong>Extremely</strong> Rare." The body is anywhere from tan to
                            cream, and the extremeties are mottled orange and brown or blue. This coat can only
                            be achieved when an orange cat breeds with a purebred siamese cat that has one of
                            the Standard Breed color coats. Not only that, but the resulting kitten
                            <em>must</em> be female. As mentioned earlier, female cats need two copies of the
                            orange gene to fully exhibit an orange coat. Tortie points are the result of one X
                            chromosome carrying the orange gene, and the other X not. Technically, male tortie
                            points do exist, but are <em>even more rare</em>. This is because they have two X
                            chromosomes and one Y!
