        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Erin Chacon, pronouns they/them. It's nice to (virtually) meet you!</p>
           <p> I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Web App Development at MCC. This is actually my second shot at college! I have a Bachelor's in Digital Culture Art and Film Media Production from ASU. I didn't know what I wanted back then (who does at 18?!) but after living some life I'm doing it again, but this time with more confidence.</p>
           <p>I work as a freelance artist who designs anything from characters to merchandise. I sell a lot of my work at events such as art shows and comic conventions! With this new degree, I want to merge my design skills with coding and technology to hopefully work in web design or UI/UX.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I love making things. When I'm not working I'm sculpting or sewing! I also love to travel, and spend a lot of time taking care of my cats (and the neighborhood ones, too!).</p>
